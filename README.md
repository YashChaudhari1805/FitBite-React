## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- The [FitBite backend](../fitbite-backend) running on port 3000

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashchaudhari1805/fitbite-react.git
cd fitbite-react
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env.development
```

The default value (`VITE_API_URL=/fitbite`) works as-is for local development — Vite proxies it to the backend automatically.

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production

```bash
cp .env.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production — set VITE_API_URL to your deployed backend URL
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder to Vercel, Netlify or Cloudflare Pages
```

## Subscription Access Rules

| Page | Guest | Basic | Pro | Ultimate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| About | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Recipes | 🔒 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Workout | 🔒 | 🔒 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Profile | 🔒 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Diet Tracking | 🔒 | 🔒 | ✅ | ✅ |

Access rules live in `src/utils/subscriptionAccess.js` — edit that file to change which plan unlocks which page.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Base URL for all API calls. Use `/fitbite` locally, your backend URL in production. |
